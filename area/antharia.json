You will find \n\rthat, if you go through the room descriptions carefully, there are many \n\rplaces that you could add to this area.  For example, antharia.are tells \n\rand hints of a great temple; therefore, you could write a temple area to \n\rbe connected to this area using the history below and the knowledge of \n\rthe area rooms, etc.   Other possible area ideas based on antharia.are \n\rwould be: a zoo including some interesting creatures that antharias had \n\rkept from the time of their submersion to animals that they have \n\rencountered under the water (which you will find a great connection point \n\rfor), a temple area (explained above), or Grand Antharia which you will \n\rsee MANY hints about in the area file itself.  In other words, I believe \n\rthis area could help many builders with new and creative ways to add to \n\rtheir muds.\n\r     \n\r     I do ask that you inform me if you use this area, and if you write \n\rany more areas that use the idea of Antharia.  \n\r------------------\n\rCurrent Email:  reece@tinuviel.cs.wcu.edu\n\rCurrent muds:  Barren Realms:  dogwood.liii.com 8000\n\r\t       Evermore MUD :  204.215.32.27 4000\n\rCurrent BBSs:  ISCA:           bbs.isca.uiowa.edu  (name: Bugle Boy)\n\r\n\r\n\rThanks,\n\rAmadeus\n\r"

			"text":	"This is taken from the latest edition of the Barren Realms High\n\rSchool History textbook..\n\r\n\r\tThe kingdom of Antharia, one the new discoveries of the modern\n\rworld, has a very intestesting history.  Being one of the oldest races\n\rof beings in existence, they have much knowledge that we do not, and\n\rmuch knowledge that they no longer posess.  We can see this more\n\rclearly by studing a bit of the history of the capital city, Antharia. \n\r\tAbout a thousand years ago, Antharia was a very productive and\n\rthriving kingdom, so old that many problems that face most kingdoms\n\rhad been solved.  The Realm was ruled by what they called a\n\rconstitutional monarchy.  They had a king, who worked as a figurehead\n\rand public leader.  However, the true working laws and policies were\n\rdictated by a two councils:  The High council of Wizards, and the Holy\n\rOrder of Priests.  These two groups worked very well together, and\n\rmade Antharia one of the best places to live. It was these councils\n\rwho made the discovery that would change the lives of every Antharian.\n\r\tIt was discovered that there was going to be a major upheaval\n\rof the world's outer crust, which would make the whole country of\n\rAntharia, which was actually a big island, in essense, sink into the ocean. \n\rFearing for the lives of their citizens, the councils worked quickly\n\rto come up with a solution to the disaster.  \n\r\tAfter many months of searching, it was decided that there was\n\ronly solution:  the wizards would have to combine their power to\n\rcreate a \"Gem of Salvation\".  This gem would, in essense, keep the\n\rwhole city of Antharia with air, even underwater -- a dome, if you\n\rwill.  However, this also forced the government to make the decisions\n\rof who would be able to live and who would die...the city could only\n\rhold so many people.  \n\r\t\n\r\tThe Antharians are very hesistant to talk about this time in\n\rtheir history.  Understandbly, it was very hard to make those\n\rdecisions; therefore, much of the next few decades are lost to us.\n\rHowever, there was to be an even more dramatic change in the lives of\n\rthe Antharians.\n\r\n\r\tAs the Antharians were getting used to living in an underwater\n\rcity, the council of wizards made another discovery which almost cost\n\rus the culture of Antharia forever.  The gem was working, but getting\n\rweaker with every day.  Not anticipating this, the wizards again\n\rstarted looking for solutions to this problem.  With the help of the\n\rpriests of Anthar the wizards came up with the solution that created\n\rthe Antharian people that we know today.\n\r\tThey had decided that the only way of saving their people was\n\rto transform themselves into Creatures that could breathe water.\n\rHowever, this process took the powers of all the wizards of Antharia,\n\rand that meant that none of the wizards could be transformed.  Knowing\n\rthat this was the only hope for their people, the wizards made this\n\rsacrifice.  The Day of Transformation is still celebrated as a holiday\n\rto this day -- and the wizards who gave up their lives are revered in\n\rloving memory.\n\r\n\r\tWe are lucky that these wizards took time to teach their\n\rstudents the way to take care of the Gem.  It was altered to simply\n\rprovide stable gravity and protection from preditors and falling\n\rdebris.  The gem is still functioning to this day.\n\r"
