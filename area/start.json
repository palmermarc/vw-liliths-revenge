They are found at \n\rthe nexus points where several \"lines\" of natural energy (that mankind \n\rcalls magic) intersect and create a surge in the lines of powers.  The \n\rscience of geomancy had vanished centuries before.  Only myths and \n\rcrackpot practitioners of magic had any inkling about ley lines and \n\rmystic energy.  Consequently, no one could have anticipated the fate that \n\rawaited humankind.\n\r\n\rNuclear holocaust ignited the destruction of the world as we know it, but \n\rit was not the primary instrument of destruction.  The sudden destruction \n\rof a billion people triggered a surge in the ley lines.  All that psychic \n\renergy sent the energy rippling through the mystical crossroads of earth \n\rlike an earthquake.  Ley lines flowed with energy that had not been felt \n\rfor a million years.  The energy surged and pulsed and crisscrossed \n\racross the planet at the speed of light.  At ley line intersections \n\r(known as nexus points), rifts in space and time tore open, releasing \n\reven more energy.  The earth shuddered and heaved.  Millions more died, \n\rincreasing the energy level of the rifts.\n\r"
