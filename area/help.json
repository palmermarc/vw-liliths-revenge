Other abilities:\n\r\n\r* Fangs - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.\n\r* Bite - Transforms target into a vampire, but costs the vampire 1000 exp.\n\r* Order - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.\n\r* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.\n\r* Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.\n\r* Clan channels are also available now. use the first 4 letters of your\n\r  clan+talk .. e.g. nosftalk, gangtalk, malktalk etc...\n\r* Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.\n\r* Vclan - Shows information on the other members of a vampires clan.\n\r* Feed - For feeding other vampires with your blood.\n\r\n\rIn addition, all vampires get 3 or more disciplines, each of which grant \n\rone or more extra powers.
