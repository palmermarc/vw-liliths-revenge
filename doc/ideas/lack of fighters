Ideas:
1) Make it so you cannot quest ac onto equipment till fighter.

2) Take out the avatar level, have it 'train immortal'. As avatar, there is
far less risk than other status levels, because people only need 1 cap to
'leave' this level. If as soon as you 'train immortal', you are 'open' to
be killed by anyone of the first 5 status levels, that immediately opens up
more competition.

3) As an alternative to 2, azazel suggested having it so you have to be
immortal to be a vampire. Thus, mortals could train avatar and have
chat/other benefits/etc, but to progress beyond 'basics', they have to
enter pkill. (Then have something wherby you always stay status 1, once you
have taken one head, even if staked etc).

I'm sure there were other ideas, woz a couple of weeks back, will post if i
remember them
