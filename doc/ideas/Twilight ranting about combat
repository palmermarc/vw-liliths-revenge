
there should be a timer.. so u can not flee and jump straight into shadowplane.

u should not be able to decap somsone who is in the normal plane if in shadow... yes it can be done ask rigel 

u should not be able to cast spells on people who are not on your plane.. 
people in shadowplane casting charm to people on the normal plane

fights are just too bloody long..
20-30 rounds + to kill somsone 12kish...
more rounds if they are healing each round
immagine when they are fleeing? with no flee-lagg (or apparent one)
its impossible to catch somsone.. unless u find them low....
