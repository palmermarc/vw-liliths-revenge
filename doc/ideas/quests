Here is an idea:

how about some kinda quests, that vampires do
individually, or in a group, and achieve rankings for,
for example: have say 5 levels of Quests. First level
quite easy ranging to 5th level damn hard (would
involve being at least 10k+, indest and some cunning).
Tasks being like getting an item of a mob, delivering
it to someone, making a potion, etc.....toughness of
mobs / number of items could all increase as level of
quest gets harder.

this info could be displayed in the players finger
like:

This player has completed Tasks 1, 3, 4
