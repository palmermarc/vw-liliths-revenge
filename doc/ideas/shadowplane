
Could spells be made so that nonshadow cant target spells on shadow ones and vice versa.  (especially curse summon etc heal i will leave to yur discretion).

For the new changes, when you escape you drop out of shadow plane, I 
think this is a good idea, follows a WOD theme. No vampire could 
maintain that sort of concentration while morted/torpor. Therefore I 
suggest for continuity in the mud, that ALL vampire powers drop, 
shield, fangs, true sight etc.
