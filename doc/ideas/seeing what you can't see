
Sensible, quite sensible.
The option to what was it? gag the stuff done by someones?
That is how i would understand it ... how can you see that someone is 
shivering and suffering if you can't see them?
Are there certain things that you would be able to detect, though you 
could not see them?
Mayhaps you'd hear it?
Mayhaps gag all stuff done by someones except for stuff that either 
affects you, or when they say something audible.

I'm thinking, if someone performs an emote/social on you ... hug, 
kiss, etc. ... whether or not you see them, you can detect that.
And, if someone talks ... via say, chat, etc. ... if you have ears, 
you can hear that.

So, what would be the config option?

+someone ... You will only see emotes/socials/channels from someones.
-someone ... You will see all actions performed by someones.
