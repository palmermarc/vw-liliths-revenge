Maybe it would be best to have a pk arena of several rooms where the only way out is to be decaped, but both players would have to agree to be put up there.  There are several different strengths in pk besides age and size, such as good tactics.  I've seen smaller people hold advent because they are good at tactics, but your idea would destroy their strengths.  If anyone could be summoned for status regardless of their wishes to a 1 vs 1 room, these smaller players would get challenged and killed whenever they went to a new status level.  It would get a lot of caps for bigger/older people that don't want to bother with hunting, but thats about all.  One of the best parts of the game is planning out and executing a decap, not having it served up to you on a platter for 100qps.
