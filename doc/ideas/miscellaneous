
- I was thinking what if we made group exp a little better and then eventually made an area for GROUPS of big ppl only...that'd be cool....for right now we have the deep to bash in a group but the group exp just isn't all that great

- I still like the idea of a Vampire Hunter that picks a random player to hunt, and make them tough as hell, heh heh.

- this is suppose to be the Masquerade, well, what happens when a player or players break the Masquerade? Maybe make some kind of change to fit in that...

- I also think it'd be cool if  the immunity to backstab was removed, hehe - and backstab fixed so it only does a fair amount of damage and stuns a player....That'd be kinda kewl.  It'd make backstab more useful... and more likely to be used.....

- What's a blind screen reader?  How does it work?  Can we support it?

- Dead people stay dead for a few RL days.  They can play other characters during that time, but the dead character can't play.

- If you don't use a skill you get 'rusty' at it, losing points in that skill.  Just to sweeten the blow you'll be able to train it back again twice as fast as someone who's never been at this level before.

- Slow down combat, make it more strategic.  Perhaps Final Fantasy style recharge timers and menu choices?

- Admin should have no clan alliegance at all.  Clan heirarchy will be made up entirely from player characters (i.e. Justicars are just the beginning).  This makes admin more focused on being admin and more immune to slurs on their impartiality.

- Temporary deny/siteban (reset on reboot)

- Have a 'pray' channel that everyone use but only admin can hear.

- Do something to put shapeshifted people on a combat par with normal armoured players.

- autogold   - like autoloot but only loots the gold

- fleetimer should affect shadowplane - so ppl cant flee then immediatetly shadowplane

- make it so  switching back to normal plane from shadowplane doesnt take blood.

- make it so that the lag on summon/being summoned is the same - so ppl won't use summon/recall triggers to keep from being summoned.

1.  I suggested the when someone is masked
(Obfuscate:Mask) as someone else, it would show the
real person behind the chat/tell/say to only the
admins.  

2.  The shop keepers say come back at specified time
rather then come back later.

3.  Could we put something like review on immt
channel?  Could be called RImmt??  In case we are
snooping someone, we can just type that rather then
scrolling up to see what we missed?!?

Any way, just a thought...
