My other main idea would be to introduce Diablrie into the mud.
First mort someone, instant
Diablrie instant
<info> Mrputty has begun to diablrie instant
It takes about 1-2 minutes for the diablier to take place, while the 
diablrie going all vampire powers drop.  Making it easy for clannies 
to come and disrupt the diabrlie by attacking the person doing the 
diablerization.  
<info> mrputty has diablrierized instant
Instant loses 10 age or so. And mrputty gains it.
In the score it marks down who you diablerized, and prevents you from 
diablerizing them again.
This being a heinous act, escpicaly in the Vampire community your 
beast should increase by 10?
They would then become mortal, and sent to temple,
Preventing a diablrie stake cap combo.

Pros:  more fun, gives alternative to capping,  could be used as yet 
another thing in the players league. Makes people wary, would 
encourage pk.
