Okies I don't know if this is going to help or not,
but on the other mud I was adminning on (the one I
quit Palmer) they recently brought out this thing
called a "blood plane". Basically it was similar to
shadowplane in that you could see the same ppl etc in
the zone rah rah rah. Only thing is. If you were
bashing in the blood plane you got 1.5 exp instead of
1 exp for your mobs. The catch was that you could only
escape the blood plane by being capped. You could
enter it freely at will. BUT. The blood plane was
basically like an arena for ppl to pk, and fleeing is
not possibly in blood plane. So if someone found you
and wanted to pk you, your flees would not work, hence
the added risk to bash in there. Don't know if this is
interesting to you guys or not but hey.
