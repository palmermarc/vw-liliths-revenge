I think it would be beneficial if 3rd gen princes could buy claneq 
from qlist or qbuy for their new clannies.  This individuals have 
already  proven their leadership potential, and are trusted by 
their clan leaders (or else they wouldn't be prince).  Also, code 
has made it impossible to change wear locations or wear claneq from 
another clan, so it would be very hard to abuse this code.
