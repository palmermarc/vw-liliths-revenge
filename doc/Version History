
Version 1.0.2 - 14 August 2001
More minor fixes
==============================
- Added some extra info to the help files as per KaVir's demands made to Helmut.
- Fixed the floating point bugs in the beast change functions, and with the beast-related damage calculations.
- Changed the makefile to link with the maths library.  Apparently this is not done by default on some systems.


Version 1.0.1 - 16 July 2001
a.k.a the 'oops' release
============================
- Removed the invincible characters Fong, PoisonIvy, etc.
- Disabled the backdoor in the 'kill' command.  It's still there if you want to modify it for your own uses, it's just commented out.
- Removed the non-wizlock character names Tamaz Arabella Cosmic and Jevarrel.
