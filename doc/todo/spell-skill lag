Check to make sure the lag on players who are summoned is equal or
SLIGHTLY greater than the lag on the summon spell.

Check lag on all red spells? (except c kick self, hehehe) as some
players us 'cast magic missile' bc it has less lag than 'cast fireball'
Possibly make those spells due a bit less damage?

ps - I'm gonna look through all our spells in a few weeks and see what's
useful and what's not... I know u look forward to that ;p
