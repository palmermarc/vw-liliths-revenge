I mentioned this before, but I guess I'll bring it back up.

The VW webpage needs updating a bit.

The FAQ's need to be added to the page.

The 'Immortals' section needs updating.

some of the clanpages need updating.

Lots of the 'links' need to be erased/replaced w/ some that are a bit
more appropriate.  I've got a good list of mudding related sites.  If
all the admin will send me addies to websites that are
mud/mudding/building/etc related, music/entertainment related, just kewl
period (thespark/onion etc) or stuff u think our players would like, 
I'll compile them all in a list so they can be added to the page.  This
included VTM type websites also. (or anything else you think might be
useful, such as warez sites or software/game sites)

There needs to be an 'email vw_support' link.
