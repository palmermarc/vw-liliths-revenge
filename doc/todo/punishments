G is it possible to get a 'play time related' flag in pfile so that things
can be undone in x amount of game time?
so u can be unstakable <ie darkhearted for 20 RL hours>?
so that being caitiffed as punishment would do some good...

- Sinbin needs to be expanded to show who set the punishment and the
time. (would be super cool if you could set a punishment with a time to
expire, but that's another thing)
