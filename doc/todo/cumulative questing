I like the idea of making it possible to keep adding ac to your armor.
 
Also, possibly make it so you can unquest stuff off an item, but it costs the same amount as if you were requesting an item.
 
For instance, if you had a piece of eq with 2 str on it, for 40 qps you could remove that +2 str, and free up room for any hit/dam, ac, or another stat you may have forgotten.  I've seen people quest things when they're newbies, and because they mis-quest one stat, have to sac the eq and start over.  This isn't that big of a problem for most stuff, but claneq (or indest if bigger people make mistakes) can't be sacced for a qps refund, so thats at least 760 qps they've wasted.  The ability to remove quested stuff off an item would help newer players while they're still learning what needs to be quested and where.
