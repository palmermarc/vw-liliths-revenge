is above succumbing to the false emotions generated by flattery, and as a
mere mortal he finds the Elves' fear amusing.

You have emerged from the dark forest on the plains of the Elven Monarchy
of Celene, ruled by the good Queen Yolande, under the guidance and
watchful presence of her God and Mentor, the Elven Immortal Corellon Larethian.
Tall spires rise in the distance, emerging from the magnificent Elven city of 
Celene, to which the path you are upon leads.

and allies of the Elves of Celene. However, despite their benevolent
nature, the Unicorns dislike intruders, especially armed and aggressive ones,
and will not hesitate to use extreme force to evict these intruders. In
addition, to protect these creatures, the Elven sorceror Theodain Eriason has placed
powerful enchantments on this place that prevent magical attacks on the
unicorns.

farmhouses and various creatures of the wild that stop to stare inquisitively
at you as you pass. The gates of the city are now visible, as are the guards
stationed near them, their colorful rainments dazzling you even from this
distance. In the near distance there appears to be a monument of some sort.

monument erected, dedicated to the many Elven Lords who died during the 
ferocious Goblin Wars that devastated most of the Elven Nations. The statue 
shows a band of Elves courageously defending an unarmed woman and her child 
from a band of hideous Goblins, and is quite brilliantly fashioned. There is
an inscription at the base of the statue.

tobacco, and that she specializes in it. She also has a wide range of other
substances, including potions, herbs and healing salves.

constantly on guard for troublemakers or looters. However, the City of
Celene is always open to peaceful travellers, and it has not been necessary
to close the City Gates for six decades.

can be easily defended, and you spy pots of oil atop the walls ready to pour

handling mostly cases of petty crime (the Elite Guard handle serious 
problems). They frown on civilians entering their premises, but will
tolerate your presence for they will recognize you as a mere ignorant
foreigner who probably doesn't speak enough Elvish to understand when

elderly elf is busy fiddling with a rather strange contraption upon which he
places black plastic discs from which a rather odd sound emerges, along with
much scratching and hissing. He has quite a collection of these disks, which
are packaged in luridly-colored paper envelopes, replete with pictures of
rather weedy-looking, long-haired, pale-skinned humans (?).

You have entered what looks like a jumble sale, a huge pile of goods of all
sorts towering in the center of the room. Atop all this sits the Halfling
Guildmaster, grinning madly at you.

Baleith Street~
You are heading along Balieth Street, which is home to the Guildmasters and
Guildmistresses of Celene. At the far end, to the south, lies the tower
of the Elven Guildmaster, and the legendary Library of Celene, while to
the north lies the opulent Palace of the Prince.

The Avian Guild is to the west of here, and the Illithid Guild to the east.

Avian Guild~
A strange, birdlike creature gazes curiously at you as you enter his Guild,
especially if you are a non-avian, for there is little he can teach you if
this is the case. Otherwise, the teacher recovers and sets out to teach you
what he can.

impressive tower, similar to those in the toehr three quarters of the City,
towering high into the sky, tapering to an unadorned point, in this case
housed in platinum sheeting. Guards occasionally march past, as do several
important-looking noblemen and women.

There is a desk on this level, unmanned, but which bears a register. There is
a large bulletin board on the wall behind the desk, between tall statues of
Aya and Mala, the Father and Mother of Learning in Elven Culture.

able to barely push open, wedged as it is by a huge pile of books. Giving it 
a final shove, the door flies open, scattering books across the floor of the
dusty study you have entered, startling the Archmage Theodain Eriason, who to your growing
dismay is becoming very angry. He stares grimly at you as you stutter out an
apology, and simply demands that you fulfill whatever business you have with
him or begone forthwith.
You see a tattered scroll stuck to one wall.
