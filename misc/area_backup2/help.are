-1 NEWS~

No news is good news?

To see the changes, type 'help changes'.
~

0 CLANROOMS~
Clanrooms have changed.
Gone is the old clan corridor, so don't bother looking there for
your clan rooms (assuming you are in a clan that is :> ).
To find your clan rooms, head for the courtyard of Joker's castle,
and look around the edge of the market place for an archway containing
the symbol of your clan. When you find it, just say the name of your clan, 
and you will be taken to your clan rooms. The secret entrance for all clan 
rooms works the same way, so ask your deity(s) where it is, as most of them 
will have changed. Non clan members may only enter your clan rooms if 
invited (ie you send a portal out to them) there is no other way for a non 
clan member to get in (short of godly intervention), though people in the 
clan rooms 'can' be summoned out.

If your clan room has not been updated, or you can't find the archway for it
complain to your clan deities, because they havn't mailed us the info we
need yet :<

Enjoy.
~

-1 REPOP RESET~
A REPOP is the timed resetting of mobs and items in an area. Since players
are always killing the mobs and taking the items for personal use or quest
cards, the mud must replace them.  Each area resets at a set, predetermined
rate.  An area will REPOP/RESET at a much faster rate if all the players
in that area leave.  It will REPOP if players are in the area, but it is 
MUCH slower.  This is why from time to time a player might ask you to leave
an area for a brief moment so he/she/it can get a quest item.

~

-1 TRADITIONS TRAD TRAD~
The First Tradition: The Masquerade
     Thou shall not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood.
     Doing such shall renounce thy claims of Blood.
The Second Tradition: The Domain
     Thy domain is thine own concern. All others owe thee respect
     while in it. None may challenge thy word while in thy domain.
The Third Tradition: The Progeny
     Thou shall only Sire another with the permission of thine elder
     If thou createst another without thine Elder's leave, both thou 
     and thy Progeny shall be slain.
The Fourth Tradition: The Accounting
     Those thou create are thine own children. Until thy Progeny 
     shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things.
     Their sins are thine to endure.
The Fifth Tradition: Hospitality
     Honour on another's domain. When thou comest to a foreign city
     city, thou shall present thyself to the one who ruleth there. Without
     the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.
The Sixth Tradition: Destruction
     Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind. The right of
     destruction belongeth only to thine Elder. Only the Eldest amoung
     thee shall call the Blood Hunt.
~

0 MORTAL MORTALS~
When a player initially logs on to the mud, he or she is a MORTAL. MORTALS 
are just like you and me, they can die. It takes them a long time to heal.
They are limited in their abilities. In other words, Mortals are weak.

The main advantage to being a mortal is: Players can't harm you.  You will
not be PKilled. This doesnt mean that you can stay mortal and harass others.

When a mortal feels that he or she is ready for the PK enviroment of the 
mud, it can train AVATAR. This should only be done after much consideration,
because it's a rough world and the PK on VW can be extreme and heartless at
times.  If the only reason you are training avatar is to chat, maybe you
should rethink this, young avatars who chat a lot get killed a lot.

3 RULES~
The Ten Commandments:
1)  Kill and decapitate other players, or else:
2)  Other immortals will kill and decapitate you.
3)  Forgiveness may be divine, but vengeance is much more fun.
4)  Don't whine or complain, or someone will kill you.
5)  If someone whines or complains, you should kill them.
6)  If someone DOESN'T whine or complain, kill them anyway.
7)  Might makes right; A corpse will never betray you.
8)  Friends are useful.  So is the exp you get for decapitating them.
9)  Rules and alliances are there to be broken; never trust anyone.
10) Stop reading the stupid rules and let the slaughter commence!

NOTE - These are the 'roleplay' rules, for the PROPER rules of this
       mud (ie the ones you get deleted for breaking) see HELP LAW.

-1 NEW NEWBIE~
TO ALL NEWBIES (mortals and such)
Suggestion 1: Shaddup - talking / chatting will get you killed
Suggestion 2: ask once - do not pester people
Suggestion 3: there will always be ways to kill newbies -
              don't bug ppl and you won't be a statistic

A NEWBIE should recall to 'The Temple of Midgaard' and say 'take me home' 
to enter the newbie zone. You will find easy to kill mobs and a set of
newbie eq here.

Just a few of the changes round here...
  
11.29.2018 Raziel: Haven't felt like updating this all the time, I may now..

See also: OLDCHANGES 
~

0 DAMAGE~
When someone attacks someone else, a damage message is displayed to give 
you an idea of how much damage you have caused.  The following messages 
represent the following amounts of damage.

If you missed, then you did 0 points of damage.
If you hit very lightly, then you did 1-10 points of damage.
If you hit lightly, then you did 11-25 points of damage.
If you hit hard, then you did 26-50 points of damage.
If you hit very hard, then you did 51-75 points of damage.
If you hit extremely hard, then you did 76-99 points of damage.
If you hit incredably hard, then you did 100-150 points of damage.
If you hit amazingly hard, then you did 151-250 points of damage.
If you hit stupendously hard, then you did 251-450 points of damage.
if you hit unfeasably hard, then you did 451-600 points of damage.
if you hit impossibly hard, then you did 601-999 points of damage.
if you hit supernaturally hard, then you did 1000 or more points of damage.

You final blow will be a death move, depending on your weapon type.
~

0 LOSTEQ~

Insert Lost EQ message here.

~

0 DECAPITATE DECAP~
syntax: DECAP <player>

If you are an avatar or higher, you may decap a mortally wounded player 
who has your status or higher.  By decapping a player you gain one status 
point, and half of the current exp they have in hand. (ie, if they have 
1 mil exp you get 500k exp).

A player that is decapped loses all of their exp, 1 immunity, and 1 of each 
attribute. 

After a player is decapped, their head must be 'cracked' and their brain
destroyed so they can call their eq. 

see also: help STATUS, help CRACK, help DEATH
~

0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.

After the head is cracked, the brain must be destroyed by eating it.  
**Remember Vampires cannot eat food** (Vamps can feed the brain to a mob)

~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment and gold.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is ALL of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

You also lose 1 random immunity (unless you're a vampire, then
you lose heat ;> ), and 1 of each attribute (str/int/wis/con/dex).

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~

0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the Temple of Midgaard when 
mortally wounded. This comes in handy when you are morted by an agressive 
mob (or player).  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move to 
0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless at 
recall...so be careful how you use it.  

see also: help STRUGGLE~

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~

0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For more information on quests, type 'help quests'.
For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
For information on how to quest, type 'help questing.'

~

0 EXPERIENCE XP EXP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many 
players are in your group; your size (total hps/mana/move){this is the main 
factor}, your age, your status, how hard the mob is to kill, and some random
variations.

See also help on STATUS and TRAIN.
~

0 STATUS~
This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are avatar or above.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure 
of how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

     0  = Avatar
 1 - 4  = Immortal
 5 - 9  = Fighter
10 - 14 = Adventurer
15 - 19 = Champion
20 - 24 = Warrior
25 +    = Hero

see also: LEAGUE, DECAP, DEATH
~

0 SKILL~
Syntax: skill | skill <player>

This shows the target player's skill with the weapon they are currently 
wielding.  The following shows the different skill ratings:

1) Totally unskilled.			 6) Very dangerous.
2) Slightly skilled.			 7) Extremely deadly.
3) Reasonable.				 8) An expert.
4) Fairly competent.			 9) A master.
5) Highly skilled.			10) A grandmaster.

Note that these are only rough estimates; one master might well be 
slightly more skilled than another master, and so on.

See also: SPELL SSKILL WEAPON BASIC~

0 SPELL SPELLS~
Syntax: spells | spell <colour>

This shows your spell casting ability with the various types of magic.

1) Untrained.				 6) An adept.
2) An apprentice.                    7) A mage.
3) A student.				 8) A warlock.
4) A scholar.				 9) A master wizard.
5) A magus.			       	10) A grand sorcerer.

Note that these are only rough estimates; one master wizard might well be 
slightly more skilled than another master wizard, and so on.

0 DONATION DONATIONS~
-
--
I will set-up a fund for donations, we are considering making the move to 
a commercial site at some time in the future, any donations would make this 
easier/possible.  

Basically any money sent will be put aside, and not spent,
and will ALL go towards the muds future, i want to get us hooked up to
mudconnector.com or the likes, which has multiple networked T3 modems, which
means NO LAG! ... ever!
We need the setup fee's, then we have to pay monthly subscriptions, i am well
aware we aren't going to get enough money from players for the monthly payments.

But once myself, Bella and Archon get ourselves more settled in work, if we
have some help from the players we may well move to mudconnector.  We make no 
promises, but we remain hopeful.

Speak to valis for details please.

0 UPDATE~
- Azazel updated this on July 26, 2000.  ;p
- Read help changes.  
- Azazel updated this on January 4, 2001.
~

9 GODLESS~
Msetting a player to godless means that they will now longer be affected by
most god commands, including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze,
etc.
~

0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

Your 'home' will be reset to the temple if you are staked.

A home cannot be a safe room. (Or other "special" rooms that we choose)
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQ EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.

See also: CLAIM
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~
FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 ANSI COLOUR~
Syntax: ansi

This will show things in colour.  Spells will appear in their appropriate 
colour, and important messages will be highlighted.  Your exp (or opponents
condition if you're fighting), hp, mana and move are shown in scaled colour.
Scaled colour is represented as follows:

Cyan   : Maximum.
Yellow : 75% to just below maximum.
Green  : 50% to just below 75%
Blue   : 25% to just below 50%
Red    : Below 25%

Ansi colour can be toggled on and off with the 'ansi' or 'config' commands.
~

0 STANCE STANCES~
Syntax: stance <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
CRANE   : A solid stance, letting you hold your ground, while providing
          good defensive moves.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics
          to keep you out of harms way.
VIPER   : A fast, striking stance, which sacrifices defence for speed
          and accuracy.
BULL    : A low stance designed for very powerful and aggressive attacks.

To see a table with your skill leval in each basic stance, type: BASIC
There are also advanced stances. For help on these type : help ASTANCES 
See also: SKILL SSKILL WEAPON
~

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

it's power has been greatly reduced. 
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

'Your message doesn't get through' - This will appear when your target is unable
to get your message, i.e dead, mortalled, or in a silenced zone etc...

Syntax: yell     <message>
syntax: bid      <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION/BID, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE ALL will attempt to remove all items currently equipped.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

0 CHANNELS~
Syntax: channels
Syntax: channels +<channel>
Syntax: channels -<channel>

With no options, CHANNELS shows you your current channels.  With a plus or
minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.

You must be an avatar to use channels.

Several players have mentioned a roleplay channel, and I think that 
vamptalk works well as a roleplay channel <unless you get staked>.
It is best to consider all public channels as potential roleplay
venues, including 'say.' However, it is safe to say that not all 'tells'
are 'in character.'  Tells between Players and Admin should always be 
considered 'out of character.'

~

0 CONFIG~
Syntax: config
Syntax: config +<option>
Syntax: config -<option>

This command configures some of your character behavior.  With no options,

0 PRIMAL~
Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
primal energy is only one-use, and is generally used for very powerful 
spells, such as 'voodoo' (which uses 5 points) and 'quest' (which uses 1 
to 100 points - see HELP QUEST).
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES BLOOD~
Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed 
to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for 
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will 
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store 
some blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, 
none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat 
immunity take normal fire damage rather than double.  Other abilities:

* Fangs - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.
* Bite - Transforms target into a vampire, but costs the vampire 1000 exp.
* Order - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
* Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
* Clan channels are also available now. use the first 4 letters of your
  clan+talk .. e.g. nosftalk, gangtalk, malktalk etc...
* Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.
* Vclan - Shows information on the other members of a vampires clan.
* Feed - For feeding other vampires with your blood.

In addition, all vampires get 3 or more disciplines, each of which grant 
one or more extra powers.  For more information type 'help disciplines'.
The VAMPIRE command toggles on/off whether vampires may bite/feed you.
See Also:  help BEAST
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

SIRE allows the target vampire of your clan to sire another vampire.  
Once a single vampire has been created the power is lost, but can be 
granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Deity has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).
~

0 DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINES DISC CLANDISC~
Each vampire (except for the original one) has three disciplines from 
which their powers come, although these disciplines vary from clan to 
clan.  In addition to the basic three, vampires are allowed to select 
from one to three additional personal disciplines, depending on their 
generation.  Personal disciplines are identical to clan disciplines in 
all ways, except that they are not passed on to further generations.

There are nine disciplines, each with the following powers:

* Protean       - Nightsight, Claws, Change.
* Celerity      - Extra attacks.
* Fortitude     - improved Damage resistance.
* Potence       - Improved damage.
* Obfuscate     - Mask,Shield.
* Obtenebration - Shadowplane, Shadowsight, Nightsight.
* Serpentis     - Darkheart, Serpent, Poison.
* Auspex        - Truesight, Scry, Readaura.
* Dominate      - Evileye, Command, Shield.

For more information, type 'help <discipline name>'.
~

0 PROTEAN~
This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

The powers available to this Discipline are as follows:
* Nightsight: Gives the vampire full night vision, which is much better 
than normal infravision.
* Claws: Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
* Change: Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 50hp and greatly 
enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
attack each other.
~

0 CELERITY~
This Discipline explains the legendary superior quickness of vampires.  
Using the Celerity Discipline allows a vampire to move extremely quickly 
and have extra attacks in the same round.
~

0 FORTITUDE~
Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However 
with the Fortitude power, they resist damage even further by often keeping 
the weapons from harming them at all.
~

0 POTENCE~
This Discipline defines the superior strength that vampires often 
possess.  This physical might allows the user to inflict much larger 
amounts of damage in combat than normal.
~

0 OBFUSCATE~
Kindred with this Discipline excel at hiding among and away from crowds.  
When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

Kindred with this power gain the following advantages:
* Mask: Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
* Shield: Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
~

0 OBTENEBRATION~
Obtenebration allows the user to manipulate the powers of darkness.  By 
using their powers they are able to switch between the normal plane and 
the SHADOWPLANE at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.

syntax: shadowplane  (You need full blood to use this power.)
syntax: nightsight   (This power is the same as Protean nightsight.)
syntax: shadowsight  (This power shows both planes.)
~

0 SERPENTIS~
Serpentis is the art of temptation and corruption.  Vampires with this 
Discipline have the ability to tear out their own hearts, rendering 
themselves immune to being staked.  Serpentis users also gain the ability 
to transform themselves into a giant serpent and back at will.  The third 
ability available to vampires with this Discipline is the ability to run 
their tongues along weapons, coating them with a deadly snake venom.

syntax: darkheart
syntax: serpent (This will change you back to humanform also.)
syntax: poison <weapon>  (This power does not work.)
~

0 AUSPEX~
This Discipline is one of extrasensory awareness, empathy and 
perception.  Those using this Discipline tend to be strongly affected by 
environmental phenomena.  Vampires with Auspex are able to see and sense 
things most other people cannot.  Auspex is the opposing Discipline to 
Obfuscate, and they cancel out many of each others powers.

This Discipline allows the following powers:
* Truesight: The user can see everything, whether invisible or whatever.
* Scry: Allows you to view the room that the specified target is in.
* Readaura: Gives you detailed information about a creature or object.
~

0 DOMINATE~
This discipline reflects the mystical ability of vampires to influence 
the minds and actions of others.  Dominate is an aspect of the power of 
the mind and the will.

This Discipline allows the following powers:
* Evileye: The user gains a lot of control over people foolish enough to 
  look at them.  Not yet fully working.
* Command: The user can issue a command that the target will be compelled 
  to obey.  This will only work on those who's minds are much weaker than 
  the vampire's.
* Shield: Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
~

0 IMMUNE IMMUNITY IMMUNITIES RESISTANCES~

instance charm.

a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.

NOTE - Higher status people do not have the same luxuries as low status
       people. After all, you should not be Fighter and above if you are
       a coward. Because of this, if you are fighter or above, you will
       not earn as much experience if you have a wimpy value set, and
       once you reach Adventurer status, you may not have a wimpy value
       set at all (for those of you that are Adventurer or above allready
       and have a wimpy set, it will no longer make you flee in combat ;p ).

Syntax: zap      <wand>  <target>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as 
opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical 
scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  
ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and 
you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target. You must
HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a 
single charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical 
object has no more charges, it will be consumed.

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

Syntax: group <character>

just FOLLOW <yourself>.

Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~

being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

0 QUIT SAVE BACKUP BACK BKUP BK~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not. Some objects, such as keys, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere on the mud.  When you re-enter 
the game you will be back in the same room.  You can't quit while fighting.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

**BACKUP backs up your playerfile - this means that if you save a corrupt  **
**playerfile and cannot log on with it, we can restore the old pfile,      **
**saving, basically, your arse. IT'S UP TO YOU TO BACKUP!      DON'T BACKUP**

**log a shagged pfile either, if you get shagged, your backup will be too! **

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.  If you fail
against a mob, it will typically attack you. There are *NO* penalties for 
using STEAL on other players, except that it announces to the mud when you 
fail, so if you spam steal and fail everytime - you spam the mud and that
will get you in big trouble.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

*NOTE* - Currently, steal is a useless skill, you will be able to steal
         NOTHING of value from a a mob you cannot kill and if by some chance
         you do manage to steal something from a player, it'll probaly be
         claimed and they'll just type: call all and get it back.

the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

difficulty of a quest card is totally random.  A one point card could

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.

part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.

There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT~
Syntax: CLAIM <object>
Syntax: CALL <object>
Syntax: CALL ALL
Syntax: GIFT <object> <player>

CLAIM:
You can claim your equipment while it in your inventory for a small cost
of 5000 exp per item. When you have claimed your items you can then use
quest points to improve the equipment and also you can then use CALL on it.

CALL:
Call simply summons the equipment back to your inventory no matter where 
it is, even if someone else is using or wearing it. Call all calls all items,
whereas call <item> calls a specific item.

GIFT:
If you have CLAIMED an item, then you can GIFT it to another player. The item
must be in your inventory, and the player must be visible in the same room as
you. It enables them to use CALL on that item, as if they had CLAIMED it.
NOTE: You can't gift Indestructable or Autoclaim EQ.

0 BEAST~
	Your BEAST value is ranged between 0 and 100, if you get your BEAST to
0 the your a rewarded with immunity to sunlight(called GOLCONDA). Your beast
will always fluctuate, so keep an eye on it! To reduce your beast, you need 
to cast heal on a MOB.
	To raise your beast, there are various things you can do, but 
common ways are berserking, casting frenzy, backstabbing, not drinking 
blood AND decapping players. (There *could* be others ;>)
	There has been a major change to the way beast works.  Now, if your 
beast is low, it will be easy to raise it. The lower the beast, the higher 
the chance of raising it.  Also, as your beast gets lower, it will become 
much harder to lower it.  This also works in reverse.  The higher your beast 
is, the easier it will be to lower it, and harder to raise. 
	In conjunction with this, the way the sun damages vampires has changed. 
Low beast means low damage and high beast means high damage.  Eventually, 
most vampires will have a beast of approximately 50.  All new vampires will 
start with a beast of 50.  It will be easy to raise/lower it at this number.
	Remember, there are LOTS of dark areas on the mud.  You can type 'safe' 
or 'weather' to find them.  Vampires aren't supposed to wander about in the
sun without taking damage, so look for dark places during the day.

0 DELETE DEL~

This will delete your player file from the game forever. So be warned!

Don't come asking us for a restore because you got bored, disgusted, or 
logged on drunk.  It really annoys us.

0 RECHARGE~
Syntax: RECHARGE <quest card> <quest machine>

When you get to the quest machine use this command with the machine to 
get your card recharged and to recieve your token.

If you get 4 items (or if just one of the items) on the card are too hard
for you to get or you have no clue where to find them, you may 'reset' the
card by recharging it.  This will cost you however many quest points the 
card is worth.  If your card is worth 100 QP, it will cost you 100 QP to
'reset' it to 4 new (and random) items.  Remember that the 4 new items MAY
be more difficult to obtain than the original 4.

To 'reset' a card, type:  recharge <quest card> <quest machine>

0 ASTANCES ADVANCED-STANCES ASTANCE~
Advanced stances are a combination of two other basic stances - To use them, you
must be Grand Master in two basic stances, although you have to find out which
ones yourself! The types of stances are these :

swallow  - Quick and agile, this stance keeps you moving, and is the
           ultimate defensive stance.
cobra    - A well rounded stance, combining speed of offense with a
           solid defense.
panther  - Fast, and agile, leaping attacks that provide defence and rain
           constant blows down on your opponant 
lion     - A solid stance, that sacrifices defence for an all out offensive
           assault.
grizzlie - A nasty combination of solid defence, with attacks of raw power
           make this a stance to be feared.
falcon   - Just like the falcon, this stance is agile, and yet able to
           make powerful, punishing attacks.

Remember, you have to find yourself out which basic stances you need to get
these. For syntax and information on basic stances, type : help STANCE

-1 MOB MOBILE MOBS~
MOB stands for MOBILE, which is a computer generated monster/entity. 
Another word for them is NPC or Non-Playing Character.

~

0 LEVEL LEVELS LEVELLING~
Levels are used in many MUDs, but not in Vampire Wars. Normally they dictate
various things, such as what areas you can get into and other stuff, but in
Vampire Wars, you don't have to worry about levelling.

One other thing is that you don't have to train at a secific place, such as 
an acolyte or guild master. You can train any place that you like, provided 
you have enough experience points. For more information type: help train
or : help experience
~

-1 WEB HTTP URL WWW HOMEPAGE INTERNET NET~
This mud has a world wide web site, the address of which is

  http://

character in certain files, and so cannot be stored in help files.

enough said!
~

-1 AVATAR AVATARS~
AVATARS are players on the level of STATUS above Mortal. You start off as a
Mortal, which means that you can die from being attacked and killed by MOBS.
When you train up to AVATAR level (this costs 1000 experience points) you can 
only be killed by being DECAPITATED by someone of the same STATUS as you or 
lower, and can only be mortally wounded (when you get to -10 hp).

Mortals cannot attack or be attacked by anybody except a MOB, which means that
they are safe from other players in the game.

One thing to remember is that some players don't like it when other players
train up to avatar status when they are still weak and pathetic. If you *are*
still very weak, it is advisable to stay mortal until you can stand up to 
other avatars. Weak players are liable to be mortally wounded, tied up 
gagged and blindfolded by other players if they do go up to avatar too soon.
It is advisable that you gain 2000 hps/mana/move before you train avatar.  
For refrence: some players have well over 10,000 hps/mana/move with hit/dam 
of 250/230.  They WILL kill you quickly.

You can also chat when you reach avatar status.

0 LAG~
Lag sucks big time. It's where the network gets mucked up and everything starts
going really  s l o w l y. There is also a social called LAG which displays to
other players <player> starts complaining about the terrible lag. If you ever
find a cure to lag, you'll be rich. But then we all know you won't. Lag is the
equivalent of a day when you come back from a hard day at work and find that your
fridge has broken down and all the beer has gone warm and flat.

Complaining about lag doesn't help, so don't bother - you're probaly not the
only person lagging.  And besides, who wants to wait several minutes to see
somebody complaining?  Lag is caused by several different things, most commonly
a downed router on the net.  Although it can be caused by the server VW is on,
this isn't common.
~

0 REVEAL~
Syntax: cast reveal
Syntax: cast reveal <player>

REVEAL is a spell that, when cast on another player, reveals their true nature,
ie if they are a vampire in human form, it turns them from vampire to human.

REVEAL with no arguments casts reveal on the caster.
~

0 STAKE STAKING~
Syntax: stake <character>

To stake a vampire, you must be holding a stake in your hand. Once staked, a
vampire loses all it's powers and is no longer a member of the clan or even a
vampire anymore. Finding stakes is hard to do, as players were changing clans
very often, which is not something that they should be able to do. Therefore
stakes have been taken out of the game in most places, so the only way to find
one is to get one created using quest points, or use another stake. Once used, a
stake cannot be re-used.

You cannot stake a vampire in human form, or one who has used the darkheart
discipline to tear out their own heart.
~

0 CLONE~
Syntax: cast clone

CLONE is a spell that creates a clone of yourself. It will not have any of your
equipment or the same attributes as you, just stand there and be you. It is
useful if you are being hunted by another player(s) to fool them into thinking
that you are somewhere you aren't, and faking your own death. You cannot create
clones of other people.
~

0 HUNT HUNTING~
Syntax: hunt <mob>

If you are in the same area as a mob you need to find, you can HUNT it down by
using this command. It tells you the direction that the mob is in.
Be careful because if you hunt a mob that is dead, you won't be able to find it, 
and if you hunt a mob that is the same name as something else you will find it 
hard to find the right one.

HUNTING takes up a certain amount of MOVE every time you move it tells you which
direction the mob is in.

Use this skill wisely - it is not for those who don't understand it.

To use this skill properly, you need to PRACTICE it.

***Players can NOT be hunted***
~

0 'ARMOUR CLASS' 'ARMOR CLASS' AC~
Your ARMOUR CLASS (or AC) represents how well armoured you are. By typing "score"
you can find out the current value of your AC - the lower the better. You can 
decrease this by getting better armour to wear, with a better armour value. Use
IDENTIFY to find out the AC value of an item.

When you cast IDENTIFY you will notice that armor says 'Armor class is #' 
This is the 'protection' ac.  This costs 1 qp per point to raise. To raise 
the protection, type: q <item> protection #.
  
The armor will also say 'Affects armor class by #' This is the 'ac.'  This 
costs 20 qp per point to raise.  To raise this type: q item ac -#.

syntax: quest <item> indest

eq 'indestructable.'

This ability costs 500qp per item.  Items that are made indestructable

0 ROLEPLAY~
ROLEPLAY is the act of 'portraying' a 'character' that is not the 
person's real personality. The 'character' is often one that follows 
a specific clans stereotypes, and has special individual traits that 
the person has selected.  Serious RP'ers tend to stay 'in character' at 
all times, while other mudders do not roleplay at all.

On VW, roleplay is not required, but it certainly makes it more fun.  
We the admin encourage RP.  However, most of the players on the mud 
do not RP.  We hope that this will change in the future.

0 LEGENDARY~
Equipment gains the LEGENDARY flag when a  player spends a certain

0 BODYPARTS PARTS ~
Sometimes while exploring the mud, a player becomes injured.  Most times it's 
minor, a quick heal will fix it, but sometimes it is more serious, and a 
player will find him/herself without one or more of his/her bodily appendages.  
When (not if, but when) this happens, don't spam the 'chat' channel w/ requests 
for a BODYPART.  You can often find a bodypart yourself by killing weak mobs 
with certain weapon types (slice/slash/claw/etc).  You can also 'cast locate 
<bodypart>' and find some parts.

If you're missing an eye - ask once and then put it in your title.. somebody 
will help you eventually.  If you repeatedly ask - you will probally end up 
much worse.

**You CAN regenerate eyes even if both of yours are poked out if you have one
in your inventory**

various ways.  You can raise the Hitroll, damroll, attributes, add spells, 
lower ac, reduce weight, and add/remove special flags.
The syntax for questing different things on EQ follows:

Hit/Damroll:  quest <item> hitroll/damroll <number>
ProtectionAc: quest <item> protection <number>
AC:           quest <item> ac < -number> (make sure this # is negative!)

0 HITROLL HIT DAMROLL DAM~
A player's HITROLL is the number that the mud uses to determine how likely 
it is that a player will hit a target.  The higher the HITROLL, the more 
likely a player is to hit a target.

A player's DAMROLL is the number the mud uses to determine how much damage 
a player will do when he hits a target.

There are other factors involved, but a player's HITROLL and DAMROLL give a 
good indication of their relative power.

The maximum HITROLL/DAMROLL on the mud is 250/230 (unspelled).
~

0 DONATE~
syntax: DONATE <ITEM>

DONATE sends an unwanted item to a special "Donation Room" where other 
players may take it for their own use.  This is especially helpful to
newbie players.  If a player is a vampire, all donated items go to their
clan's donation room.

0 KILLING PK~
This mud is PK mud.  PK stands for Player Killing, and that is the main 
activity intended for players to participate in.  Sure, killing huge 
monsters is fun, but they typically cannot think, so they offer little 
challenge.  If you do not like PK, maybe this isnt the mud for you, because 
if you AVATAR here, you WILL be killed sooner or later; if no reason other 
than the fact that you are an avatar.

However, if you feel you are ready for KILLING, there are a few things you 
should take into consideration.  When you first log on, you won't be able 
to compete with most people who have only played a few hours more than you.  
Don't despair, with a few hours of work, you will be able to compete.  Don't 
let initial drubbings by HUGE players who are typically 5 to 10 times your 
size or age discourage you.  Of course they can destroy you, they're big, 
old Vampires.

You should spend your time hunting and killing people who are within your
age bracket (give or take 25-50 years).  A few thousand hps, hitroll/damroll
of at least 50/50, and ac of -250 will put you on par with most advanced 
newbies, and on a road to fun.  Remember: Vampires are hard to kill.

0 NAME NAMES~

Insert your rules and/or guidelines on names here, if necessary.

~

0 QLIST  QBUY~
syntax: QLIST
syntax: QBUY <item>

Players can now create their own 'created' eq without the aid of an Admin.  
To see which items you may create, type: QLIST.  To purchase the item, 
type: QBUY <ITEM>.  The QP price for each item will be automatically removed 
from your pfile.  You will be given a created item with a generic name.  If 
you would like to change the name of this eq, please feel free to go fighter, 
and then you can rename it yourself.

see also: CLAIM, SPELLPROOF, FBONUS, INDEST, QUEST, and QP.
~

0 JUSTICAR~
The justicar is the player's first point of contact for clan issues.  The 
justicar has authority to make decisions on inter and intra-clan matters 
such as wars, alliances, who to bite, how the clan should role-oplay, etc.

Justicars are GODS/IMMS, but not full fledged ADMIN.  They only handle clan 
matters, but they can give advice on how to play Vampire Wars Mud.  This 
does not mean they should be disregarded, show them the same respect you 
should show all ADMIN.

At the current time, not all clans will have Justicars.  These clans will 
keep their regular Admin leader.
~

0 FINGER~
The FINGER command allows you gather information about
players that are online while you are on the mud.

To FINGER a player, you must be able to see them, so make
sure you have the 'detect invisible' and 'detect hidden' 
spells.

When you FINGER a GOD/ADMIN, they are notified, so do not SPAM them with 
FINGER, or you will pay the price.
~

0 BUGS LOOPHOLE LOOPHOLES~
A BUG <not to be confused with the BUG command> is an undesired feature of 
the code. BUGS can often be abused for personal gain, giving a player an 
unfair advantage.  Abuse of BUGS can lead to serious punishment, including 
deletion.  If you find something you think is a bug, report it immediately.
Remember that reporting it does not give you the right to abuse it until it
is fixed.

A LOOPHOLE is a way around limitations put in place by the code, or 
rules/laws put in place by the coders. Players that purposefully seek out
ways to find a way around these limitations, especially new ones put in 
place specifically to solve a bug/problem, really piss the admin off.  Don't
do this.  Players should try to beat other players, not the code.
~

0 GOLCONDA~
For most Kindred, to be a vampire is to be eternally Damned.  To become 
vampire means being forever forsaken by God and man.  Even those that scorn
this legend find a personal Hell in their BEAST. The BEAST controls many 
aspects of a vampire's unlife, including how much damage a vampire takes 
from the sun.
	Among vampires there is a fabled state of trancendance known as 
GOLCONDA. A vampire who has attained GOLCONDA is said to have gained a 
complete mastery over it's BEAST (and an immunity to damage from the sun).
	As the stories go, GOLCONDA is known only to a few among the undead, 
and these no longer participate in the Jyhad or the society of their kind.  
They are loners, who live at one with the animals in the wilderness.  They 
are hallowed creatures who no longer have the inborne need to kill.
	If your beast is 0, and you kill, it always goes up, but the more you 
kill (or do any other beastly thing) the less likely it is to go up.  So at 
50, it's not very likely to raise because you did something beastly. Vampires
with extremely low or high beasts are extremely rare. (or will be soon)
~

0 SAFE~
This command allows a player to determine if he or she is in a 'safe' room.
Players are protected from being attacked in safe rooms, but may be commanded
or summoned from them.  It also tells a vampire if he or she is safe from 
the sun.
~

0 AUTOCLAIM~
Certain items, usually very powerful ones, are automatically claimed when
a player picks them up for the first time.  These items cannot be gifted
to other players.
~

0 CRASH~
A CRASH occurs when everybody gets kicked off of the mud then 100 seconds 
later they get to reconnect and grumble.  CRASHES affect all players of 
the mud, and can be caused by any number of things.
~

0 REVIEW~
Syntax: Review

The Review command will allow you to see the last 10 tells and replies that 
were sent to you. It will also log your tells and replies to the other player.
This will help you see all those 'missed tells'.
~
