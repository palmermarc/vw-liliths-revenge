A clear mountain valley sprawls about. To the northwest and southeast,
thick vallenwoods flash yellow and scarlet against the bright autumn sky.
To the east shimmers the cool blue of the Crystalmir Lake. Westward, the
valley enters a canyon rimmed by granite cliffs. The valley floor itself
continues to the northeast.
Some distance away, a group of huddled men pulls a large cart slowly
west down the Haven road. They sway rhythmically. Coarse, heavy robes
completely conceal their features.

Stone bridge~
The Solace Stream sparkles beneath an ancient stone brige. Water tumbles
out of the forest, over the rocks, and toward the Southpass that lies between
southern Sentinel Peaks. West of the bridge, the road splits in two, branching
to the south and the west. Both roads wind among the great vallenwoods,
whose boughs form a brilliant canopy over the roadway.
